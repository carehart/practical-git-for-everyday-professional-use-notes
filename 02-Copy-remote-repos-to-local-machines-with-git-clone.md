## Pulling a Remote Repo into a Local Directory

If we want to have remote repository on our own computer, we can use the `git clone` command.

1. In the command line, navigate to the directory you want the remote code files to be in.

2. In the browser, navigate to the remote repository you want on Github and click the **"Clone or download"** button. Copy the URL provided.

3. Back in the command line, type `git clone` followed by the URL you just copied.

You can practice this with the [repository Trevor works with](https://github.com/trevordmiller/utility-functions) in the video.
